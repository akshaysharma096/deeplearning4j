# DL4J auto-generated documentation

Run `./gen_all_docs.sh` to generate documentation from source for all supported projects,
then change into the subdirectory of a project and run `mkdocs serve` to see the respective documentation
at `http://localhost:8000`.

To deploy a new version of documentation, first make sure to set `$DL4J_DOCS_DIR` to your local copy of 
https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-docs. Then run `./copy-to-dl4j-docs.sh`. This puts documentation
into the right folders and you can create a PR from there to change docs.
